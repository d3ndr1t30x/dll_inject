Breakdown of each step:

  Import Libraries: Import ctypes for calling C functions in DLLs, and sys and os for handling system-specific operations.

  Define Constants: Define constants for process access rights (PROCESS_ALL_ACCESS), memory allocation (MEM_COMMIT, MEM_RESERVE), and memory protection (PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE).

  Load Windows API Functions: Load kernel32.dll to access Windows API functions for process and memory management.

  Define the inject_dll Function: Create a function to handle the entire DLL injection process into the target process.

  Open Target Process: Use OpenProcess to get a handle to the target process with all necessary access rights.

  Allocate Memory in Target Process: Allocate memory within the target process using VirtualAllocEx to store the DLL path.

  Write DLL Path to Allocated Memory: Use WriteProcessMemory to write the DLL path into the allocated memory in the target process.

  Get Address of LoadLibraryA: Retrieve the address of the LoadLibraryA function from kernel32.dll using GetProcAddress.

  Create Remote Thread in Target Process: Create a remote thread in the target process with CreateRemoteThread to execute LoadLibraryA with the DLL path as an argument.

  Wait for Remote Thread to Complete: Use WaitForSingleObject to wait for the remote thread to complete the DLL loading.

  Clean Up: Free the allocated memory with VirtualFreeEx and close all handles with CloseHandle.

  Main Function to Execute the Script: Parse command-line arguments for the process ID and DLL path, validate the DLL path, and call the inject_dll function to perform the injection.
